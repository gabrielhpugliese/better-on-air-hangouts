Better On Air Hangouts is an extension for Google Chrome that improves Google+
On Air Hangouts by making the player larger or opening it in a new tab.
Love watching On Air Hangouts on Google+, but are frustrated with the tiny size
of the player? This extension adds two options to help you out.

-----
New in version 1.5: Now you don't have to start the video playback in order to
get access to the New Tab, Embed and Stream URL options.
-----

Expand Video increases the width of the player to fill the Google+ stream,
which makes it easier to see what is going on while still being able to see
the comments.

Open Player in New Tab opens a new Google Chrome tab containing a fullscreen
version of the stream, so you can watch the Hangout with as much detail as
possible.

Create Embed Code generates code you can use to embed the stream player in
your blog or website.

Get the Stream URL shows you the URL for the raw video stream so you can watch
the Hangout in a video player.
